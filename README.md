# Motivation
This is final project for the Haskell-course in Innopolis University, Summer 2022

# Prerequisites
This project can be build with Cabal and GHC 8.10.7 or with Stack tool. We recommend that you use ghcup to install these.

# MVP features
Minimal blockchain system, the whole chain runs on one local machine without any
user interaction, minimal prerequisites for secure digital signatures and hashing.
### Additional:
• CLI command line chain explorer

• PoW (Proof of Work)

• Secure digital signature (probably modified NTRUsign) 

• Blockchain dumper
